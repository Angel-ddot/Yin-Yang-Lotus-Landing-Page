# Reflection on AI Use

**Which AI tool(s) did you use?**  
I used ChatGPT as my AI coding assistant.

**How did it help you?**  
It helped generate the structure for the landing page, styled the design with the brand’s colors (purple and lime green), and added responsive elements like hover animations and the simple contact form confirmation message.

**What challenges did you encounter?**  
I had to adjust the AI-generated design to make it reflect the mission of Yin & Yang Lotus. Balancing professionalism with warmth in the design was challenging, especially since this is a nonprofit-style organization.

**What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?**  
I learned that AI is a great tool to speed up coding, create a professional base design, and generate animations or layouts quickly. However, I needed to understand the structure and make edits so it aligned with Yin & Yang Lotus’s mission. AI works best as a supportive collaborator, not a full replacement for hands-on customization.
